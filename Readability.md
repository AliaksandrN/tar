## Readability by Rob Pike

* If a language has too many features, you waste time choosing which ones to use.
* Then implement, refine, possibly rethink and redo.
* Later, “Why does the code work this way?”
* The code is harder to understand simply because it is using
  a more complex language.
* Preferable to have just one way, or at least fewer, simpler ways.
* Features add complexity. We want simplicity.
* Features hurt readability. We want readability.
* Readability is paramount.

### Readable means Reliable

* Readable code is reliable code.
* It’s easier to understand.
* It’s easier to work on.
* If it breaks, it’s easier to fix.
* If the language is complicated:
  - You must understand more things to read and work on the code.
  - You must understand more things to debug and fix it.
* A key tradeoff: More fun to write, or less work to maintain?
